## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: JOURNAL frontmatter is writable only via digest-mark

Skills SHALL update `docs/journal.md` frontmatter (specifically `last_digest_at`) only via `memon journal digest-mark`. No other skill SHALL touch the frontmatter. Skills MAY only `memon journal append` event lines to the body.

#### Scenario: append-journal does not touch frontmatter
- **WHEN** reviewing `packages/skills/memon-append-journal/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** the document states explicitly that the skill never modifies `docs/journal.md` frontmatter, only appends event lines

#### Scenario: digest-journal is the only cursor-advancer
- **WHEN** reviewing `packages/skills/memon-digest-journal/SKILL.md`
- **THEN** the document is described as "the **only** skill that updates `last_digest_at`" and is the sole skill that calls `memon journal digest-mark`

### Requirement: Spec-mutating skills SHALL preflight-check the FS convention version

Every memon skill that reads or writes spec files (the per-experiment `<runDir>/README.md`, the project's `<projectRoot>/docs/hypotheses.md`, `<projectRoot>/docs/journal.md`, or any file under `<projectRoot>/docs/digests/` or `<projectRoot>/docs/reports/`) SHALL invoke `memon fs-version check --project-root <p> --format json` as the first executable step in its workflow body, parse the result, and branch as follows:

- `status === "match"`: proceed with the rest of the skill.
- `status === "behind"`: surface the gap to the user (current version, expected version), recommend invoking `memon-migrate-fs`, and stop. The skill SHALL NOT proceed to read or write any spec file.
- `status === "uninitialised"`: surface that `<projectRoot>/.memon/version.json` is absent and recommend running `memon install-skills` first. The skill SHALL stop.
- `status === "ahead"`: the CLI subcommand has already exited `MEMON_TOO_OLD`; the skill SHALL forward this error to the user and stop.

This preflight section SHALL appear in the skill body using consistent language across skills, so that an agent reading any memon-* skill encounters the same preamble shape. The exact preamble text is canonicalised in the bundled skills' source; skills SHALL NOT diverge from it.

The following skills are subject to this requirement (matching the user-invoked skill set plus the model-invocable append-* skills):
- `memon-write-script` — writes launcher scripts (does not directly mutate spec files, but is part of the run-experiment workflow that does).
- `memon-run-experiment` — writes `<runDir>/README.md`.
- `memon-digest-journal` — reads `docs/journal.md`, writes digests, advances cursor.
- `memon-write-report` — writes report files under `docs/reports/`.
- `memon-propose` — writes proposal artifacts.
- `memon-append-journal` — appends event lines to `docs/journal.md`.
- `memon-append-warning` — appends warning rows to `<runDir>/README.md`.
- `memon-migrate-fs` itself is exempt from preflight (it IS the migration entry; it reads `.memon/version.json` directly as part of its own protocol).

#### Scenario: Skill body contains the preflight preamble
- **WHEN** a reader inspects the workflow body of any of the six listed skills
- **THEN** the very first numbered step (or a section labelled "Preflight") executes `memon fs-version check --project-root <p> --format json`
- **AND** the step explicitly enumerates branches for `match` (proceed), `behind` (stop with migrate-fs recommendation), `uninitialised` (stop with install-skills recommendation), and `ahead` (stop with MEMON_TOO_OLD message)
